🏎️ A simple C program that simulates lap times sector by sector using straights and corners — built with a motorsport engineering approach.
# Lap-time-and-sector-analysis
This project is a simple Lap Time & Sector Analyzer built in C, designed with a motorsport engineering perspective. It allows users to break a track into straights and corners, input relevant parameters, and calculate the lap time sector by sector. 

🚀 Features
Input any number of track sectors (straights or corners).

Automatic unit conversion (km/h → m/s).

Calculates time for each sector and total lap time.

Displays results with two decimal precision (e.g., 12.03 sec).

🛠️ Technologies Used

C Programming Language

Math Library (math.h) for angle-to-radian conversions and calculations.
